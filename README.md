# Mashup
Mashup is a Python-based project that allows you to download multiple videos of a given singer from YouTube, convert them to audio files, cut the initial segment from each audio, and finally merge all audio into a single output file.

python mashup.py <SingerName> <NumberOfVideos> <AudioDuration> <OutputFileName>

<NumberOfVideos>: The number of videos to download from YouTube (should be greater than 10).
<AudioDuration>: The duration (in seconds) to cut from the beginning of each audio (should be greater than 20).
